//! Tool-call approval primitives shared by runtime, API, and operator surfaces.
//!
//! This module contains the **type foundation** for tool-call approval
//! workflows (distinct from the more general [`crate::policy::ApprovalDecision`]
//! / [`crate::events::ApprovalRequested`] pair that services plan review,
//! prompt-release, RFC 022 triggers, and so on).
//!
//! Two enums live here:
//!
//! * [`ApprovalMatchPolicy`] — how to match *future* tool calls against an
//!   operator decision. `Exact` repeats the decision only for byte-identical
//!   arguments; `ProjectScopedPath` widens the match to any call whose path
//!   argument is under a given project root; `ExactPath` widens to any call
//!   whose path argument equals a specific absolute path.
//!
//! * [`ApprovalScope`] — whether an operator decision is `Once` (this call
//!   only) or `Session { match_policy }` (all subsequent matching calls in
//!   the same session).
//!
//! These types are additive — they are introduced in the "tool-call approval"
//! event foundation wave (PR BP-1) and are **not** consumed by any service
//! yet. Subsequent PRs in the wave wire them into `ToolCallProposed`,
//! `ToolCallApproved`, projection state, and the execute phase.
//!
//! Design notes:
//!
//! * Both types use `#[serde(tag = "kind", rename_all = "snake_case")]` so
//!   that the JSON wire shape is a discriminated union — operators and
//!   plugin authors read these payloads directly via SSE / audit log.
//! * Paths are carried as owned `String`s (not `PathBuf`) to keep the type
//!   serde-friendly and portable across OS boundaries. Canonicalisation is
//!   the concern of whichever matcher consumes the policy, not the policy
//!   itself.

/// How a tool-call approval decision should match *future* calls.
///
/// This enum is referenced by [`crate::events::ToolCallProposed`]
/// (what the operator is being asked to match on) and
/// [`ApprovalScope::Session`] (how a "approve for session" decision widens).
///
/// In terms of matching breadth, `Exact` is the narrowest policy,
/// `ExactPath` is broader, and `ProjectScopedPath` is the widest. The
/// matcher is expected to compare arguments *after* canonicalisation
/// (symlink resolution, trailing-slash handling, etc.) — that
/// canonicalisation is deliberately not encoded in the type so that
/// the same policy can be reused in contexts where only a subset of
/// canonicalisation is available (e.g. replay).

        /// underneath it as `project_root + path_separator + rest`.

/// Scope of an operator approval decision over a proposed tool call.

/// `Once` is the default safe choice: the decision applies only to the
/// specific `ToolCallId` the operator inspected. `Session` widens the
/// decision to every subsequent tool call in the same session whose
/// arguments satisfy the embedded [`ApprovalMatchPolicy`].
///
/// There is intentionally no `Global` or `Project` scope in this PR — those
/// broaden blast radius beyond the session and need additional policy /
/// audit machinery that will be introduced in later PRs of the wave, if at
/// all. Keeping the initial enum tight makes adding variants later an
/// additive (non-breaking) change on the deserialise side.
