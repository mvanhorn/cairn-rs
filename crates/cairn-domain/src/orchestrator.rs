//! Orchestrator types — ActionProposal from the DECIDE phase.
//!
//! The orchestrator's DECIDE phase calls the LLM with a `ContextBundle` and
//! receives an `ActionProposal` back.  This module defines the proposal shape
//! and the exhaustive set of action types the orchestrator can execute.
//!
//! Also houses [`CompletionVerification`] (F47): an extractor-produced sidecar
//! that scans tool_result frames at Done and surfaces warning/error lines and
//! per-command exit codes so operators have an independent signal alongside
//! the LLM's free-text `complete_run` summary.
