//! Tool-call approval service boundary.
//!
//! This is the **runtime service** for the tool-call approval flow added
//! in the BP-v2 wave (research doc `docs/research/llm-agent-approval-systems.md`).
//! It lives alongside [`crate::approvals::ApprovalService`] — the general
//! approval service keeps owning plan review (RFC 018), prompt-release
//! governance, RFC 022 trigger approvals, and the pre-existing run-level
//! pauses. The new `ToolCallApprovalService` owns only the tool-call
//! proposal / decision / retrieve-and-execute pattern.
//!
//! The two services coexist because tool-call approval has fundamentally
//! different semantics:
//!
//! * **Proposal persistence.** The proposal's full arguments payload is
//!   what the execute phase re-runs after operator approval, not a
//!   freshly re-inferred one. See the "lost proposal" bug in the research
//!   doc for why this matters.
//! * **Match-policy widening.** A single approval can widen to all future
//!   matching calls in the session (`ApprovalScope::Session`) based on an
//!   [`ApprovalMatchPolicy`]. Generic approvals are one-shot.
//! * **Amendment flow.** Operators may preview-edit arguments
//!   (`ToolCallAmended`) any number of times before resolving.
//! * **Await-decision hot path.** The execute phase blocks on a oneshot
//!   fired from the operator ops path, with a timeout that auto-rejects.
//!
//! Grafting those onto the generic trait would break existing callers and
//! muddy two very different contracts. Two traits, one per contract.
