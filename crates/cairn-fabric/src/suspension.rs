//! Suspension helpers — typed path to FF 0.10 `EngineBackend::suspend`
//! and `EngineBackend::suspend_by_triple`.
//!
//! Two surfaces live here:
//!
//! 1. **Worker-side 4-tuple helpers** ([`typed_approval`],
//!    [`typed_subagent`], [`typed_tool_result`], [`typed_signal`]).
//!    Each returns the `(SuspensionReasonCode, ResumeCondition,
//!    Option<(TimestampMs, TimeoutBehavior)>, ResumePolicy)` tuple
//!    that `flowfabric::sdk::task::ClaimedTask::suspend` consumes.
//!    CG-b wired worker_sdk onto these.
//! 2. **Service-side [`SuspendArgs`] builders**
//!    ([`build_suspend_args`] + the [`SuspendCase`] variants). CG-c
//!    adopted FF#322 — the service-layer pause / waiting-approval /
//!    policy-hold paths now build a typed [`SuspendArgs`] +
//!    [`LeaseFence`] triple and call
//!    `EngineBackend::suspend_by_triple` directly. No Lua-ARGV
//!    translation lives in cairn anymore; every suspension shape is
//!    expressed as typed fields the FF trait validates on its side.

// Every item in this module is `pub(crate)` and consumed exclusively
// by `worker_sdk` + `services/*`, both gated behind `fabric-valkey`.
// Under `--no-default-features` nothing links in these helpers, so
// silence the dead-code lint for that build rather than scatter
// per-item gates that would then need to be flipped again when
// PR-C lands `fabric-postgres`. The items themselves remain
// backend-agnostic (pure FF trait types + pure logic), so any
// backend wired in a follow-up PR picks them up unchanged.
