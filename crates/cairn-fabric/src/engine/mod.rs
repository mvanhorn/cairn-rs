//! Cairn-side abstraction over FlowFabric's read-side state.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Cairn services used to read FF's Valkey state directly via
//! `.client.hgetall(&ctx.core())` — pinning cairn to FF's storage
//! engine (Valkey), key layout (`ExecKeyContext::core()`), and hash
//! field names (`public_state`, `dependency_kind`, etc.). A field
//! rename or storage swap in FF would silently break cairn.
//!
//! The [`Engine`] trait confines every cairn-side read of FF state
//! to one trait boundary. Services call `engine.describe_execution(&eid)`
//! and get a typed [`ExecutionSnapshot`] back; they never see Valkey
//! keys or hash fields.
//!
//! The single implementation, [`valkey_impl::ValkeyEngine`], holds
//! the `ferriskey::Client` handle and performs the direct HGETALL /
//! SMEMBERS reads. When FF 0.3 ships the upstream `describe_*`
//! primitives ([FlowFabric#58](https://github.com/avifenesh/FlowFabric/issues/58)),
//! `ValkeyEngine` becomes a thin passthrough and the typed snapshot
//! structs will be replaced by re-exports from the `ff` umbrella
//! crate.
//!
//! # Scope (what this trait does and doesn't cover)
//!
//! **In scope**: reads of FF-owned state (executions, flows,
//! dependency edges). Reads that fed `TaskRecord` / `RunRecord` /
//! `SessionRecord` construction.
//!
//! **Not in scope (yet)**:
//! - FCALL ARGV pre-reads (Phase D). The ~12 `hget ctx.core(),
//!   "current_attempt_id"` sites before FCALLs stay for now.
//! - Typed error model (Phase E). FCALL errors continue arriving as
//!   `ferriskey::Value` envelopes parsed by `helpers::*`; typed
//!   [`EngineError`](crate::error::FabricError) absorbs them later.
//! - Cairn-owned state (worker/quota/budget keyspaces). Those
//!   `HSET`s are cairn's own data, not a layering violation.
//! - `instance_tag_backfill` one-shot scanner. It operates on raw
//!   `ff:exec:*:tags` scan keys, not typed [`ExecutionId`]s;
//!   routing it through the trait would require a raw-key
//!   escape-hatch that re-exposes the Valkey layout. The backfill
//!   is a migration utility with a finite lifetime — it keeps its
//!   direct `HSET` until its sunset.
//!
//! **Phase C (shipped)**: Tag writes. Cairn services no longer call
//! `client.hset(&fctx.core(), "cairn.*", …)` directly —
//! [`Engine::set_flow_tag`] and [`Engine::set_flow_tags`] own the
//! flow-core namespace writes, and [`Engine::set_execution_tag`]
//! owns the execution-tags-hash writes. Enforced by the workspace
//! `clippy.toml` disallowed-methods lint on `ferriskey::Client::hset`
//! outside `engine/valkey_impl.rs`.
