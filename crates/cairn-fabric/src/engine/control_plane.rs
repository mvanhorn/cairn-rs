//! Cairn-side abstraction over FF's control-plane FCALLs.
//!
//! # Why a separate trait (vs folding into [`Engine`])
//!
//! [`Engine`](super::Engine) owns read-side snapshots and tag writes —
//! pure HGETALL / HGET / HSET shaped ops over FF-owned state. The
//! operations defined here are FCALL-shaped: they drive FF's Lua
//! library (`ff_create_budget`, `ff_report_usage_and_check`,
//! `ff_check_admission_and_record`, `ff_rotate_waitpoint_hmac_secret`)
//! and surface typed outcome enums that require per-FCALL envelope
//! parsing.
//!
//! Mixing the two would give a single trait ~20 methods that split
//! cleanly along read-vs-FCALL lines; splitting here keeps each trait
//! focused and lets callers take the narrowest dep they need (e.g. a
//! view-layer worker only needs `Engine`, not `ControlPlaneBackend`).
//!
//! # Phase D scope
//!
//! - **PR 1**: budget (5), quota (2), rotation (1).
//! - **PR 2a**: run lifecycle (7) + session create/archive (2) +
//!   claim (1). All FCALL-shaped; fold onto this trait rather than a new
//!   `ExecutionLifecycleBackend` — one trait keeps services from
//!   juggling two handles, and the read/tag split (Engine) vs
//!   FCALL split (ControlPlaneBackend) is already the load-bearing
//!   axis.
//! - **PR 2b** (follow-up): task lifecycle (10+ methods including
//!   `declare_dependency` retry loop + `check_dependencies` envelope
//!   walk). Deferred because that service has behaviour — multi-FCALL
//!   retry, graph-revision conflict recovery — that deserves its own
//!   scope audit.
//!
//! # Error model
//!
//! Every method returns [`FabricError`] for transport / serialisation /
//! malformed-envelope failures. Typed FF outcomes (`HardBreach`,
//! `RateExceeded`, `RotationConflict`) are surfaced inside the
//! returned [`control_plane_types`] mirror enums — NOT mapped to
//! `Err`. Callers match on the outcome.
//!
//! [`control_plane_types`]: super::control_plane_types
