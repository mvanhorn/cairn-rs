//! Typed snapshot shapes for cairn-side reads of FF state.
//!
//! These types are the contract between services and the [`Engine`]
//! trait. They re-export upstream FF primitives where those primitives
//! fully cover cairn's needs (FF 0.9 ships `LeaseSummary` with all
//! fields cairn needs — FF#278) and keep local shapes only where
//! cairn surfaces additional fields or different encodings.
//!
//! # Design notes
//!
//! - **`blocking_reason` stays an opaque `Option<String>`** because
//!   FF's Lua emits a small open set of values (`waiting_for_children`,
//!   `blocked_by_dependencies`, etc.) that FF doesn't type upstream.
//!   Cairn's `state_map::adjust_*_state_for_blocking_reason` does the
//!   translation to cairn state variants.
//! - **`tags` is a `BTreeMap<String, String>`** (not `HashMap`) for
//!   stable iteration order in logs and deterministic serialisation.
//! - **`LeaseSummary` is re-exported from `flowfabric::core::contracts`**
//!   (FF 0.9, FF#278). Fields: `lease_epoch`, `worker_instance_id`,
//!   `expires_at`, `lease_id`, `attempt_index`, `last_heartbeat_at`.
//!   Cairn's local 5-field wrapper was deleted in CG-b.
