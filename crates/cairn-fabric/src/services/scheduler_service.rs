//! FabricSchedulerService — thin wrapper over the ff-scheduler crate.
//!
//! # Phase D PR 2a exception
//!
//! Unlike `run_service`, `session_service`, `task_service`, and
//! `claim_common`, this service still imports `flowfabric::scheduler::claim::
//! {Scheduler, ClaimGrant}` directly. That's intentional.
//!
//! `ClaimGrant` is a wire-contract type shared with ff-sdk workers:
//! when a worker dequeues a grant it receives exactly this struct,
//! and the worker-side code paths in ff-sdk depend on its field
//! layout. Mirroring it cairn-side would add a conversion hop that
//! hides nothing — both cairn and ff-sdk would still have to agree
//! on the layout, and the cairn-native mirror would track upstream
//! 1:1 with every FF release.
//!
//! When FF 0.3 stabilises the scheduler types upstream (tracked in
//! [FlowFabric#58](https://github.com/avifenesh/FlowFabric/issues/58))
//! this stays an exception. Any future Phase D work that retires
//! `ff_scheduler` from cairn (e.g. cairn running its own scheduling
//! loop against the `ControlPlaneBackend` trait directly) would
//! revisit the exception — but that's a Phase E / F scope, not
//! Phase D.
