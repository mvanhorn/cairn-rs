//! Shared claim helper for `FabricTaskService` and `FabricRunService`.
//!
//! Both services issue the same two-step FCALL sequence
//! (`ff_issue_claim_grant` → `ff_claim_execution`, with transparent
//! dispatch to `ff_claim_resumed_execution` for attempt-interrupted
//! executions). Phase D PR 2a moved the FCALL machinery behind
//! [`ControlPlaneBackend::issue_grant_and_claim`]; this module stays
//! as a thin orientation point so call sites keep their familiar
//! name and the docstring above the call continues to describe the
//! two-step protocol.
//!
//! **No FF-state-plane imports live here.** The `flowfabric::core::keys` /
//! `flowfabric::core::partition` machinery moved into the backend impl
//! (`engine/valkey_control_plane_impl.rs`). This file owns nothing
//! except the delegate.
