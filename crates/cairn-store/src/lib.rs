//! Storage, migrations, event log, and synchronous projection boundaries.
//!
//! `cairn-store` owns durable persistence for all runtime entities:
//!
//! - **Event log**: append-only log for `full_history` entities (RFC 002)
//! - **Synchronous projections**: current-state tables updated transactionally
//!   with event persistence (session, run, task, approval, checkpoint, mailbox,
//!   tool invocation)
//! - **Migrations**: schema migration runner and naming conventions
//! - **DB adapter**: pluggable backend boundary for Postgres and SQLite
