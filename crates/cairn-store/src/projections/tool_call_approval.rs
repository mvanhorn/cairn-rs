//! Tool-call approval projection (PR BP-2).
//!
//! Persists the current state of tool-call approval workflows driven by
//! the four domain events added in PR BP-1:
//!
//! * [`cairn_domain::events::ToolCallProposed`] — inserts a new
//!   `Pending` record.
//! * [`cairn_domain::events::ToolCallAmended`] — updates the amended
//!   arguments and `last_amended_at_ms`; the state remains `Pending`
//!   because the operator has not yet resolved the call.
//! * [`cairn_domain::events::ToolCallApproved`] — transitions the state
//!   to `Approved`, populating `operator_id`, `scope`, and
//!   `approved_tool_args` when the operator attached an override.
//! * [`cairn_domain::events::ToolCallRejected`] — transitions the state
//!   to `Rejected`, populating `operator_id` and `reason`.
//!
//! The read model exposes by-id, by-run, by-session, and
//! pending-by-project queries mirroring the shape of the legacy
//! [`crate::projections::ApprovalReadModel`].
//!
//! The `Timeout` state is reserved for a later PR that wires the runtime
//! timeout path (PR BP-3). Projections do not emit `Timeout` directly —
//! it is a placeholder so downstream surfaces can already plan for it.
