//! F37 regression: cairn must never send a partial fence triple to FF.
//!
//! # Bug (live dogfood v5 on 2026-04-25)
//!
//! Simple text-answer tasks ("Fibonacci function", "Redstone repeater")
//! failed after 4-5 successful provider turns with:
//!
//! ```text
//! ERROR request: fabric layer error
//! fabric_err=internal: ff_complete_execution rejected: partial_fence_triple
//! ```
//!
//! HTTP response: `{"reason":"internal runtime error: fabric layer error",
//! "termination":"failed"}`. No approval-gated tools were invoked — just
//! memory_search / glob / notify_operator. So the failure wasn't a
//! waitpoint issue; it was terminal-FCALL fence semantics.
//!
//! # Root cause
//!
//! FF's `ff_complete_execution` / `ff_fail_execution` / `ff_cancel_execution`
//! use RFC #58.5 fence-triple resolution (`resolve_lease_fence` in
//! `flowfabric.lua`): the `(lease_id, lease_epoch, attempt_id)` triple
//! must be either **all three set** (normal path, FF validates against
//! stored lease) or **all three empty** (unfenced — FF server-resolves
//! and requires `source=="operator_override"`). Any mix is rejected
//! with `partial_fence_triple`.
//!
//! Cairn's `resolve_lease_context` (both `FabricRunService` and
//! `FabricTaskService`) happily emitted **partial triples**:
//!
//! * When the lease expired (default 30s TTL) but `current_attempt_id`
//!   persisted → `(lease_id="", lease_epoch="1", attempt_id="<set>")`.
//!   The 30s TTL is trivially exceeded by a 5-iteration LLM run.
//! * When the lease was absent but `current_lease_epoch` was stamped
//!   from a prior lifecycle phase → same partial shape.
//!
//! Additionally, `build_complete_execution` / `build_fail_execution`
//! never passed the `source` ARGV at all — so even when the triple WAS
//! fully empty, FF would reject with `fence_required` (terminal ops
//! demand `source=="operator_override"` in unfenced mode).
//!
//! # Fix
//!
//! 1. `resolve_lease_context` in both services now guarantees the
//!    fence-triple invariant: it's all-three-set (live lease + current
//!    attempt) or all-three-empty (unfenced). Partial is unreachable.
//! 2. `ExecutionLeaseContext` grew a `source` field, populated to
//!    `"operator_override"` in the unfenced branch and `""` otherwise.
//! 3. `build_complete_execution` (ARGV 5→6) and `build_fail_execution`
//!    (ARGV 7→8) now carry `source` as the trailing argument.
//!
//! Cairn is the sole authoritative writer of run-execution lifecycle on
//! its side (one orchestrator per run), so `"operator_override"` is
//! semantically correct. FF still enforces lifecycle-phase, terminal,
//! and revocation checks in `validate_lease_and_mark_expired`, which is
//! the real safety net.
//!
//! # This test
//!
//! End-to-end LiveHarness driven through real HTTP. Three assertions:
//!
//! * `complete_run_with_live_lease_succeeds` — create session + run +
//!   claim, then `POST /v1/runs/:id/intervene {"action":"force_complete"}`
//!   immediately. Exercises the fully-fenced path (all three tokens
//!   populated) so a future regression that blanks the fence
//!   unconditionally is caught.
//!
//! * `complete_run_after_lease_expiry_returns_clean_conflict` — same
//!   setup with `CAIRN_FABRIC_LEASE_TTL_MS=1000`, sleep 3 s so FF's
//!   expiry path fires on the next FCALL, then force-complete. Asserts
//!   the response is NOT a 500 `fabric layer error` and does NOT leak
//!   raw `partial_fence_triple` / `fence_required` / `fabric layer
//!   error` text. Either a 200 (FF's scanner hadn't run — still fenced)
//!   or a structured 4xx (`execution_not_active` / `lease_expired`
//!   surfaced as `RuntimeError::InvalidTransition` → 409) is accepted;
//!   what pre-F37 produced (a 500 leaking FCALL internals) is not.
//!
//! * `cancel_unclaimed_run_uses_unfenced_path` — pins the Lua-side
//!   `source="operator_override"` bypass so a never-claimed run (no
//!   lease present) can still be cancelled via the intervention path
//!   without tripping a partial-fence rejection. Guards a review
//!   concern that clearing `lease_epoch` in
//!   `ExecutionLeaseContext::unfenced` might regress cancel — it
//!   doesn't, because cancel's lease gate is wrapped in the
//!   `source != "operator_override"` check.

    // fence-triple regression path is never exercised).
    //
    // Phase 1: wait past the lease TTL + scanner cadence so FF has
    //          had a chance to expire the lease on an active
    //          (not-yet-terminal) run. This is the EXACT pre-F37

    //          InvalidTransition 409), NOT a 500 leaking FCALL

    // Sleep justification (Copilot round 6 #256): unlike race-based
    // sleeps that "hope the event fired", this sleep is a bounded
    // DETERMINISTIC CEILING — `lease_ttl` is set via env override and

    // cadence (see ff-script's `expire_scanner_sweep_cadence_ms`,
    // default 1000 ms, rounded up to 1500 ms for CI jitter headroom).

    // `current_lease_id == None` (FF owns the lease state in Valkey,
    // not cairn's projection — see `FabricRunService::renew_lease_if_stale`
