    // F35: threading tool errors back into the next DECIDE turn.

    // The orchestrator does not maintain a multi-turn assistant/tool
    // message history (each DECIDE is a fresh `system`+`user` call with
    // the step history embedded). So the only channel that carries a
    // failed tool result's error text into the next LLM turn is the
    // per-step `summary` string. Pre-F35 this only carried the proposal
    // `description` ("read the design document"), so even once we stop
    // terminating on tool errors the LLM would still be blind to *what*
    // failed — it would just see `ok=false` with no explanation and
    // repeat the same broken call.
    //
    // Fix: for InvokeTool proposals whose status is `Failed`, append the
    // concrete error text. For successful tool calls, append a short
    // output preview so the LLM doesn't have to guess what came back.
    // Both are truncated so a massive payload doesn't dominate the step
    // history budget on later iterations.
    // Cursor Bugbot + Copilot review feedback on PR #295: iterate
    // `execute.results` directly rather than zipping against
    // `decide.proposals`. `ExecuteOutcome::results` is flattened in
    // `execute_impl.rs` (`results.into_iter().flatten().collect()`) to
    // drop None slots for proposals that a terminal short-circuit
    // prevented from running — for example when Phase 1 sets
    // `WaitApproval` on an InvokeTool at index N, any non-InvokeTool
    // proposal at indices < N that had not yet been dispatched by Phase
    // 2 will be `None` and removed by `flatten()`. Zipping against
    // `decide.proposals` after that would shift results left and pair
    // each result with the wrong proposal, silently misattributing tool
    // error / success text.
