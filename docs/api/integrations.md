# Integrations & Webhooks

Integration plugin CRUD, per-integration overrides, webhook receivers (generic and GitHub-specific), and GitHub installation / scan / queue-management endpoints.

Source of truth: [`tests/compat/http_routes.tsv`](../../tests/compat/http_routes.tsv). Drift from this table against the live router is enforced by `cargo test -p cairn-api --test compat_catalog_sync`.
