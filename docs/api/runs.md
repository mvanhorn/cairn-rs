# Runs

Agent run lifecycle: create/list/detail, orchestration, checkpoint, resume, cancel, SLA, cost alerts, intervention, replay, diagnose, and queue visibility (stalled / escalated / resume-due / sla-breached).

Source of truth: [`tests/compat/http_routes.tsv`](../../tests/compat/http_routes.tsv). Drift from this table against the live router is enforced by `cargo test -p cairn-api --test compat_catalog_sync`.
