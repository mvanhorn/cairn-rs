# LLM Agent Skill Systems: State of the Art (2025–2026)

**Generated**: 2026-04-23
**Sources**: 40+ primary sources analyzed
**Scope**: Research-only document. This write-up does not itself modify cairn-rs code; it is the design reference consumed by the BP-8 adapter crate in the same PR.
**Purpose**: Feeds cairn-rs PR BP-8 (harness-skill adoption design).

---

## 1. Prerequisites and TL;DR

**Prerequisites**:
- Basic familiarity with LLM tool-calling (JSON schema → model call → result loop)
- Understanding of cairn-rs crate layout (`cairn-tools`, `cairn-plugin-proto`, `harness-core`)
- Familiarity with the harness-tools crate structure (see `project_harness_tools_api_cheat_sheet.md`)

### Five Key Takeaways

1. **The Agent Skills specification has won.** The `agentskills.io` open standard — a SKILL.md file with YAML frontmatter, three-tier progressive disclosure, and description-based activation — is now implemented in 35+ production systems including Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, VS Code, Cursor, Roo Code, OpenHands, and Databricks Genie. It is not a niche pattern. It is a de-facto industry standard.

2. **A skill is not a tool.** A tool is a typed function call with a JSON schema and a concrete executor. A skill is a prose instruction package that loads into the model's context and changes how the model behaves. The distinction matters architecturally: a skill is closer to a system-prompt fragment than to an API endpoint. Cairn already has a mature tool system (`cairn-tools`); skills must sit alongside it, not replace it.

3. **Progressive disclosure is the killer feature.** Loading only the ~100-token description at session start, then loading the full body (≤5,000 tokens) on activation, then loading resources on demand is what makes 50+ installed skills feasible without wrecking the context budget. Any implementation that front-loads all skill bodies fails at scale.

4. **Security is not an afterthought — it is the hardest part.** Skills are a first-class prompt injection vector. A malicious skill description can hijack the model. Untrusted project skills (from freshly-cloned repos) must be explicitly trust-gated. The `allowed-tools` field becomes a pre-approval contract in autonomous mode. Fail-closed must be the default.

5. **Cairn already has most of the required infrastructure.** The `PermissionGate` trait, `HookAction`, `PluginRegistry`, and `ToolHost` patterns in `cairn-tools` are the right seams. The skill system should integrate through them, not bypass them. The harness-skill crate (`harness-core`'s sibling) already implements the core activation mechanics — the BP-8 work is primarily a cairn adapter over that foundation.

## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1 Skill vs Tool vs Plugin vs Agent

These four primitives are often conflated. The confusion is not just semantic — conflating them produces wrong architecture.

| Primitive | Nature | Loaded how | Execution | Example |
|-----------|--------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Tool** | Typed function with JSON schema | Listed in `tools[]` array at call time | Deterministic code | `bash_exec({command: "git status"})` |
| **Skill** | Prose instruction package | Body loaded into conversation on activation | Model interprets instructions | `code-review` SKILL.md describing review criteria |
| **Plugin** | External process exposing tools via JSON-RPC | Process spawned at startup; tools registered | Subprocess | `cairn-tools` plugin host |
| **Agent** | Isolated context + its own tool loop | Spawned on demand | Separate agent run | Subagent for repo exploration |
| **Prompt** | Static instruction text | Always in system prompt | Model interprets | Global behavioral rules in system prompt |

The critical distinction between a skill and a system prompt: a system prompt is always present and always costs tokens. A skill's description costs ~100 tokens permanently; its body costs ~5,000 tokens only when activated. This is the progressive disclosure advantage.

The critical distinction between a skill and a tool: calling a tool invokes code. Activating a skill injects text. A skill can instruct the model to call specific tools, but the skill itself is not callable in the way a tool is.

### 2.2 Skill Triggering

Three canonical trigger mechanisms co-exist in all major implementations:

**A. Slash command (user-initiated):** `/skill-name [arguments]`. The user explicitly invokes a skill by name. Universal.

**B. Model-initiated (description matching):** The model reads the skill catalog (all skill descriptions, pre-loaded), decides which skill is relevant, and invokes it via the `Skill` tool or by reading the SKILL.md path. This is the autonomous-mode dominant pattern.

**C. System-prompt injection:** Skill descriptions are embedded directly in the system prompt, treated as standing instructions. Uncommon and does not benefit from progressive disclosure.

Claude Code's `disable-model-invocation: true` frontmatter field disables mechanism B for a given skill, keeping it user-only. This is essential for side-effect skills (deploy, push, send-notification) where autonomous triggering is dangerous.

### 2.3 Skill Versioning

The agentskills.io spec does not mandate version fields. In practice:

- Claude Code plugins: explicit `version` in `plugin.json`; if absent, git commit SHA is used
- Anthropic API: `skill_id` references a stored skill blob; updates require re-upload and new ID
- Filesystem skills: no versioning; editing the file changes behavior on next session restart; within a session, the body is loaded once and held

The correct mental model is: **skills version like source files, not like library releases.** A change to `SKILL.md` takes effect at the next session. There is no semver story for a single SKILL.md.

For the `allowed-tools` field and permission contracts, this means: changing a skill's declared tool permissions requires the session to restart before the new permissions are effective.

### 2.4 Skill Sandboxing

This is where implementations diverge most sharply:

**Claude Code / Claude.ai API:** Skills run in a virtual machine with filesystem access. The VM provides the sandboxing. Skills cannot escape the VM. Network access varies by surface (full in Claude Code, none in Claude API).

**Claude Code (filesystem mode):** No VM. Skills read from the host filesystem. Sandboxing is provided by the workspace fence (skills must resolve within `skill_roots`) and the trust gate (project skills require explicit trust). The `allowed-tools` field restricts which tools the skill may pre-approve.

**Anthropic Tool Search + defer_loading:** Not skill-specific; the model cannot load arbitrary content; it can only discover tools in the pre-declared `tools[]` array. Security is structural: deferred tools are still declared by the operator.

**harness-skill (avifenesh/tools):** Two-layer fence. Layer 1: workspace root fence (all paths must resolve inside `skill_roots`). Layer 2: trust gate (project-level skills require `SkillTrustPolicy` approval — hook-required by default). Sensitive-pattern matching blocks activation of skills matching configured path patterns.

---

## 3. Per-System Deep Dives

### 3.1 Anthropic / Claude Code Skills (NEW, Oct 2025)

**Primary source:** `code.claude.com/docs/en/skills`, `platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview`, `agentskills.io`

Anthropic shipped the formal Agent Skills system in October 2025 via an engineering blog post ("Equipping agents for the real world with Agent Skills"). The design has two implementations that share a common spec:

**Claude Code (filesystem mode):**
- Skill = directory containing `SKILL.md`
- Locations: enterprise (`managed`) > personal (`~/.claude/skills/`) > project (`.claude/skills/`) > plugin (`<plugin>/skills/`)
- Tool used: `Skill` tool (permission-controlled)
- Activation: Model invokes via `Skill` tool, or user invokes via `/name`
- Progressive disclosure: descriptions in system prompt (always), body loaded on invocation, resources loaded on model demand
- Key frontmatter extensions beyond agentskills.io spec: `disable-model-invocation`, `user-invocable`, `context: fork`, `agent`, `allowed-tools`, `model`, `effort`, `paths`, `shell`, `hooks`
- Live change detection: watches `~/.claude/skills/` and project `.claude/skills/` during session
- Plugin namespacing: `plugin-name:skill-name` prevents collision
- `allowed-tools` field: pre-approves listed tools when skill is active (e.g., `Bash(git add *) Bash(git commit *)`)

**Claude API (container mode):**
- Skills run in code execution containers (requires `code-execution-2025-08-25`, `skills-2025-10-02`, `files-api-2025-04-14` beta headers)
- Skills are uploaded via `/v1/skills` endpoint; org-wide sharing
- `skill_id` referenced in `container` parameter
- Pre-built skills: `pptx`, `xlsx`, `docx`, `pdf`
- Claude.ai: individual upload (not org-wide)
- No cross-surface sync; manage separately per surface

**SKILL.md format (minimal conformant):**
```yaml
---
name: code-review
description: Reviews code for correctness, style, and security issues. Use when reviewing PRs, auditing code quality, or evaluating a diff.
---

When reviewing code:
1. Check for logical errors and edge cases
2. Verify error handling
3. Flag security issues (injection, auth, crypto)
4. Assess test coverage
5. Note style violations
```

**Key design decision:** The body of SKILL.md enters the conversation as a single message and stays there for the session. Claude Code does NOT re-read the file on later turns. This is a deliberate design choice for predictability — once activated, a skill is static for the session.

**Compaction safety:** Auto-compaction re-attaches the first 5,000 tokens of each invoked skill after summarization. Skills share a combined 25,000-token compaction budget. Older skills may drop after heavy compaction — the recommendation is to re-invoke if behavior degrades.

### 3.2 Anthropic Tool Search + defer_loading (Nov 2025)

**Primary source:** `platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/tool-search-tool`

This is a different system that solves a different problem: too many *tools* (not skills) exceeding the context budget. A five-server MCP setup can consume 55K tokens in tool definitions before any work begins.

The mechanism:

1. Mark infrequently-used tools with `defer_loading: true` — they are excluded from the system prompt prefix
2. Include a `tool_search_tool_regex_20251119` or `tool_search_tool_bm25_20251119` server tool
3. When the model needs a tool, it searches; the API returns 3-5 `tool_reference` blocks
4. Tool definitions expand inline in the conversation body (not the prefix), preserving cache coherence

**Key design insight:** `defer_loading: true` preserves prompt caching. The prefix (which is cache-keyed) is untouched. The full grammar for strict mode still builds from the complete toolset, so `defer_loading` + `strict: true` compose safely.

**Numerical evidence:** Anthropic reports Opus 4 improved from 49% → 74% tool selection accuracy with Tool Search enabled; Opus 4.5 from 79.5% → 88.1%.

**Relationship to skills:** Tool search is orthogonal to skills. Skills address prose instruction packages. Tool search addresses typed function schema bloat. A mature system needs both: skills for behavioral specialization, tool search for large tool catalogs.

### 3.3 MCP (Model Context Protocol)

**Primary source:** `modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools`, `platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/mcp-connector`

MCP is a JSON-RPC protocol for typed function exposure. Key points:

- Tools are declared via `tools/list` → response includes `name`, `description`, `inputSchema`, `outputSchema`
- `tools/list_changed` capability allows servers to notify clients of hot tool updates
- Security model: MCP spec mandates user confirmation prompts for sensitive operations; servers must validate inputs; clients should show tool inputs before calling
- The Anthropic MCP connector (`mcp-client-2025-11-20` beta) moves tool configuration out of the server definition and into a `mcp_toolset` object in the `tools` array, enabling allowlist/denylist patterns and `defer_loading` per-tool

**Skill vs MCP:** MCP tools are typed function calls with deterministic schemas. Skills are prose instructions. Simon Willison's observation (paraphrased): "GitHub's MCP is tens of thousands of tokens for all tool schemas; skills are a few dozen tokens per skill description." The two are complementary: a skill can tell the model *when and how* to use an MCP tool, while the MCP tool provides the actual typed invocation surface.

### 3.4 Microsoft Semantic Kernel Plugins

**Primary source:** `learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/concepts/plugins/`

SK predates agentskills.io by two years. Its "plugins" are the closest precursor to the skill concept in enterprise frameworks.

Key patterns:
- Plugin = class; functions = `[KernelFunction]` annotated methods
- Three import modes: native code, OpenAPI spec, MCP server
- `FunctionChoiceBehavior.Auto()` enables the kernel to automatically invoke plugin functions
- Dependency injection: plugins receive services (DB connections, HTTP clients) via constructor injection — a pattern lacking in pure prompt-based skills
- OpenAI's recommendation in SK docs: no more than 20 tools per API call; ideally ≤10

**Critical SK recommendation:** "Don't be afraid to provide detailed descriptions for your functions if an AI is having trouble calling them. Few-shot examples, recommendations for when to use (and not use) the function, and guidance on where to get required parameters can all be helpful." This is the same description-quality insight that agentskills.io's spec embeds.

**What SK gets right that skills miss:** Local state management. A plugin can hold a state object; functions operate on it without leaking data to the model. Useful for confidential or large intermediate data.

**Limitation:** SK plugins are statically registered; no progressive disclosure. All plugin function schemas load into context at call time. For 5-10 plugins this is fine; for 50+ it breaks.

### 3.5 LangChain / LangGraph Tools

**Primary source:** LangGraph documentation, LangChain tool abstraction

LangChain's tool abstraction is purely functional: a tool is a callable with a description and an input schema. LangGraph adds the agentic loop: `ToolNode` processes tool calls from the model and returns results.

**When a tool becomes a skill in LangChain context:** When the description is long enough to contain behavioral instructions, you have effectively created a skill masquerading as a tool. This is a common anti-pattern: putting a 500-word procedure into a tool description. LangGraph's `create_react_agent` + `tools` parameter makes this easy to do but wrong.

**The correct LangChain skill analog:** LangGraph's `SystemMessage` injection or LCEL chain composition. But neither gives you progressive disclosure or filesystem-based authoring.

**Verdict:** LangChain/LangGraph lacks a formal skill system. It has tools and system prompts but nothing in between. For production autonomous agents, this forces teams to either load all behavioral instructions upfront (expensive) or build a custom skill-loading mechanism.

### 3.6 CrewAI Tools

**Primary source:** `docs.crewai.com/concepts/tools`

CrewAI tools are `@tool`-decorated functions or `BaseTool` subclasses with Pydantic input schemas. Skills in CrewAI are role assignments to agents: a "researcher" agent has search tools, a "writer" has file tools. This is agent-as-skill composition, not instruction-package composition.

**What's interesting:** Optional `cache_function` on tools for memoization. **Limitation:** No formal progressive disclosure; tools are statically assigned to agents at instantiation. No filesystem-based SKILL.md authoring. CrewAI is beginning to adopt the agentskills.io standard but is not yet a full adopter.

### 3.7 AutoGen Agent-as-Tool

**Primary source:** AutoGen documentation

AutoGen's distinctive contribution: `AgentTool` allows wrapping one agent as a callable tool for another agent. A "math expert" agent becomes a tool that a coordinator agent can call.

This is correct for composing complex multi-step capabilities. But it does not scale as a skill system: maintaining 30 specialist agents for 30 workflow variants is 10x the operational burden of 30 narrow SKILL.md files.

**The skill-via-agent anti-pattern:** Using AutoGen-style agent composition as a substitute for a skill system works in demos but breaks in production. Session context bleed, cost multiplication, and debugging complexity all increase non-linearly.

### 3.8 Cline / Cursor / Continue (Editor Agents)

Cline uses `.clinerules` (system-prompt supplements) and `@url`/`@file` mentions as user-driven content loading. No formal skill system as of Q1 2026.

Cursor is transitioning from `.cursor/rules/` to the agentskills.io standard. The `/migrate-to-skills` command is available.

Continue implements the `readSkill` tool (`{skillName: string}`) with `readonly: true` and `isInstant: true` — a Pattern A (dedicated tool) implementation.

**Editor-agent lesson for cairn:** Users author skills as files in their workspace. Hot-reload (no restart needed) is a strong UX requirement editors have already established. If cairn requires agent restart to pick up a new skill, it will feel broken compared to editor tools.

### 3.9 harness-skill Crate (avifenesh/tools)

**Primary source:** `github.com/avifenesh/tools` tree analysis, design doc

The harness-skill crate is a Rust implementation of the Agent Skills activation layer, designed as the 10th tool alongside bash, read, write, grep, glob, webfetch, and lsp.

**Public API shape:**
```rust
// Core execution entry point
pub async fn skill(params: SkillParams, config: SkillSessionConfig) -> SkillResult;

// Registry abstraction (pluggable)
pub struct FilesystemSkillRegistry { /* roots: Vec<PathBuf> */ }
pub trait SkillRegistry {
    fn discover(&self) -> Vec<SkillEntry>;
    fn load(&self, name: &str) -> Option<LoadedSkill>;
}

// Session configuration
pub struct SkillSessionConfig {
    pub permissions: SkillPermissionPolicy,
    pub registry: Box<dyn SkillRegistry>,
    pub trust: SkillTrustPolicy,
    pub activated: ActivatedSet,
}
```

**Output shape (discriminated union by `kind`):**
- `ok`: body wrapped in `<skill>…</skill>`, frontmatter, resource filenames
- `already_loaded`: idempotence marker (second call is no-op)
- `not_found`: includes fuzzy-matched siblings
- `error`: codes = `INVALID_PARAM | NOT_FOUND | SENSITIVE | OUTSIDE_WORKSPACE | INVALID_FRONTMATTER | NAME_MISMATCH | DISABLED | NOT_TRUSTED | PERMISSION_DENIED | IO_ERROR`

**Security layers:**
1. Workspace fence: skills must resolve inside `skill_roots`; symlinks escaping boundary → `OUTSIDE_WORKSPACE`
2. Sensitive-pattern matching: e.g., `**/.env/**` blocks activation without hook approval
3. Trust gate: project skills default to `hook_required`; hook receives frontmatter + `reason: "untrusted_project_skill"`
4. Permission hook: `hook({tool: "skill", action: "activate", path, metadata}) → "allow" | "allow_once" | "deny"`

**What's v1 complete:**
- Three-tier progressive disclosure (catalog → body → resources)
- Activation with argument substitution (`$ARGUMENTS`, `$1`, `$N`, `${name}`)
- Session-scoped deduplication (name-keyed, not hash-keyed)
- Name collision + shadowing by root index
- `disable-model-invocation` + `user-invocable` frontmatter fields
- Error codes as stable API contracts
- Unknown frontmatter fields ignored (forward-compatible)

**What's deferred to v1.1+:**
- Subagent-forked skills (`context: fork`)
- Dynamic shell injection (`` !`cmd` `` backtick blocks) — security surface, not yet sandboxed
- Live filesystem watching
- `paths` auto-activation gating
- `allowed-tools` pre-approval (currently advisory only)
- Skill composition (one skill referencing another)

**Critical design decision (correct):** `allowed-tools` is advisory in v1 — it documents what tools the skill wants, but the session's permission hook remains authoritative on every downstream tool call. This is the right security posture: no implicit privilege grants from skill authorship.

## 4. Comparison Table

| System | Trigger mechanism | Versioning | Discovery | Permission model | Composition | Security | UX |
|--------|------------------|------------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|----------|-----|
| **Claude Code Skills** | Slash cmd + model-invoked via `Skill` tool | Plugin semver or git SHA | Filesystem scan at session start; live watch | `allowed-tools` pre-approval; `disable-model-invocation`; permission rules | `context: fork` for subagent isolation | Workspace fence; trust gate for project skills; managed org override | SKILL.md authoring; `/reload-plugins` |
| **Anthropic Agent Skills API** | API: `container` param + `skill_id`; model reads via bash | Upload-and-version blob; `skill_id` is the key | Org-wide upload; metadata in context | VM sandbox; no network in API tier | Stack multiple skills in same container | VM isolation; no internet; only pre-installed packages | API upload via `/v1/skills` |

## 5. cairn-rs Current State

### 5.1 What cairn-tools already has

Reading `crates/cairn-tools/src/lib.rs`, `permissions.rs`, `builtin.rs`, and `registry.rs`:

**Tool infrastructure (solid):**
- `ToolDescriptor` / `ToolInput` / `ToolOutcome` — typed tool invocation contract
- `ToolHost` trait — `list_tools()` + `invoke()` seam
- `PermissionGate` trait — `check(project, required, execution_class) → PermissionCheckResult`
- `Permission` enum — `FsRead | FsWrite | NetworkEgress | ProcessExec | CredentialAccess | MemoryAccess`
- `PermissionCheckResult` — `Granted | Denied | HeldForApproval`
- `HookAction` — hook firing around tool events
- `InMemoryPluginRegistry` + `PluginRegistry` trait — plugin management
- `BuiltinToolRegistry` — registry of named builtins

**Plugin infrastructure (solid):**
- `PluginManifest` — id, name, version, command, capabilities, declared permissions, execution class
- `PluginCapability` — `ToolProvider { tools: Vec<String> }`
- `StdioPluginHost` — subprocess plugin execution
- MCP client/server integration

**What's missing for skills:**
- No `SkillDescriptor` type
- No `SkillRegistry` or skill catalog construction
- No skill activation hook path (distinct from tool invocation hook)
- No `ActivatedSet` for session-scoped deduplication
- No `SkillTrustPolicy` or workspace trust model
- No SKILL.md parser or frontmatter validation
- No progressive disclosure mechanism (no "description in context, body on demand" pattern)

### 5.2 The harness-skill adapter problem

The harness-skill crate (`harness-core`'s sibling) already implements the full activation mechanics. The BP-8 work is writing a cairn adapter — a shim that:

1. Constructs `SkillSessionConfig` from cairn's session context (project key, permission gates, trust roots)
2. Routes `SkillPermissionPolicy` checks through cairn's `PermissionGate`
3. Routes `hook({action: "activate", ...})` through cairn's `HookAction` system
4. Emits skill activation as a `ToolInvocationNodeData` graph event (audit + provenance)
5. Integrates activated skill bodies into cairn's run/task context
6. Exposes the skill catalog as part of the tools context delivered to the LLM at run start

The adapter connects two already-designed systems. It should not re-implement the skill mechanics already in harness-skill.

---

## 6. Design Patterns for cairn-rs BP-8

### 6.1 Skill Manifest Format

**Recommendation: Use agentskills.io spec verbatim for the spec-required fields.** Extend with cairn-specific optional fields that parse without error in other compliant harnesses (unknown fields are ignored by spec).

```toml
# Minimum valid SKILL.md (agentskills.io conformant)
---
name: run-analysis
description: Analyzes agent run output for anomalies, patterns, and suggestions. Use when a run has completed and the operator wants to understand what happened.
---

When analyzing a run:
1. Retrieve the run's event log and task list
2. Identify any failed tasks or unexpected state transitions
3. Summarize the key decision points
4. Flag anomalies: unexpected retries, long-running tasks, approval timeouts
5. Suggest improvements if patterns indicate systemic issues
```

**cairn-specific optional frontmatter fields** (all optional; safe to ignore in other harnesses):

```yaml
# Standard agentskills.io fields:
name: run-analysis         # required; max 64 chars; lowercase-kebab-case
description: "..."         # required; max 1024 chars; what + when-to-use
license: MIT               # optional
compatibility: "Requires cairn-app >= 0.5"  # optional
metadata:                  # optional key-value
  author: internal
  category: observability

# cairn-specific extensions (all optional; ignored by other harnesses):
cairn:
  disable-model-invocation: false  # default false; true = user-only
  user-invocable: true             # default true; false = model-only
  allowed-tools: []                # advisory; tools hint for audit
  approval-required: false         # if true, first-use requires operator approval
  tenant-scope: workspace          # "workspace" | "project" | "global"
```

**File structure:**
```
skills/
└── run-analysis/
    ├── SKILL.md               # Required; body ≤ 500 lines
    ├── reference.md           # Optional; detailed API/event reference
    ├── scripts/
    │   └── extract-stats.py   # Optional; executable utilities
    └── examples/
        └── sample-output.md   # Optional; expected output shape
```

**Naming constraints (from agentskills.io spec):**
- 1–64 characters
- Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only (`[a-z0-9-]+`)
- No consecutive hyphens (`--`)
- No leading or trailing hyphens
- Must match parent directory name

### 6.2 SkillRegistry Service

```rust
/// cairn-tools skill registry trait.
/// Adapts harness-skill's SkillRegistry to cairn's project-scoped context.
#[async_trait]
pub trait CairnSkillRegistry: Send + Sync {
    /// Returns skill metadata catalog (lightweight: name + description only).
    /// Called at run start to populate the context given to the LLM.
    async fn catalog(&self, scope: &SkillScope) -> Vec<SkillCatalogEntry>;

    /// Activates a skill: validates permissions, enforces trust gate,
    /// loads the body, performs argument substitution.
    /// Returns discriminated union matching harness-skill's SkillResult.
    async fn activate(
        &self,
        name: &str,
        arguments: Option<SkillArguments>,
        session: &SkillSession,
    ) -> SkillActivationResult;

    /// Returns true if skill name is valid and exists in the catalog.
    fn exists(&self, name: &str, scope: &SkillScope) -> bool;
}

/// Scope for skill resolution (project-level skills shadow workspace-level).
pub enum SkillScope {
    /// Only skills available globally (built-in, org-managed)
    Global,
    /// Workspace-level + Global
    Workspace { workspace_id: WorkspaceId },
    /// Project-level + Workspace + Global (full priority chain)
    Project { project_key: ProjectKey },
}

/// Entry in the skill catalog (progressive disclosure tier 1).
pub struct SkillCatalogEntry {
    pub name: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub scope_level: SkillScopeLevel, // Project | Workspace | Global
    pub is_user_invocable: bool,
    pub is_model_invocable: bool,
}

/// Session state for skill activation (deduplication, trust state).
pub struct SkillSession {
    pub session_id: SessionId,
    pub project: ProjectKey,
    pub activated: ActivatedSet, // session-scoped; cleared on session end
    pub trust_grants: TrustGrants,
}

/// Result of skill activation.
pub enum SkillActivationResult {
    Ok {
        body: String,               // full SKILL.md body (post-substitution)
        skill_dir: PathBuf,         // for resource reference resolution
        resources: Vec<SkillResource>, // scripts, references, assets (names only)
        frontmatter: SkillFrontmatter,
    },
    AlreadyLoaded {
        name: String,
    },
    NotFound {

    },

        verdict: PolicyVerdict,
    },
    TrustRequired {
        name: String,
        skill_dir: PathBuf,
    },
    Error {
        code: SkillErrorCode,
        message: String,
    },
}

/// Error codes (stable API; bumping major version on removal).
pub enum SkillErrorCode {
    InvalidParam,
    NotFound,
    Sensitive,
    OutsideWorkspace,
    InvalidFrontmatter,
    NameMismatch,
    Disabled,
    NotTrusted,
    PermissionDenied,
    IoError,
}
```

**Default implementation** wraps harness-skill's `FilesystemSkillRegistry`:

```rust
pub struct HarnessSkillAdapter {
    harness_registry: FilesystemSkillRegistry,
    permission_gate: Arc<dyn PermissionGate>,
    hook_dispatcher: Arc<dyn HookDispatcher>,
    graph_sink: Arc<dyn GraphEventSink>,
}

impl HarnessSkillAdapter {
    pub fn new(
        skill_roots: Vec<PathBuf>,
        permission_gate: Arc<dyn PermissionGate>,
        hook_dispatcher: Arc<dyn HookDispatcher>,
        graph_sink: Arc<dyn GraphEventSink>,
    ) -> Self { ... }
}
```

### 6.3 Integration with cairn-tools

**A skill is not a tool, but cairn-tools is the right integration point.**

Rationale: cairn-tools owns the permission gate, the hook system, and the execution class. The skill activation path must go through the same gates as tool invocation. Bypassing cairn-tools for skill permissions would create a permission audit hole.

**Proposed integration:**

1. Add a new `BuiltinToolDescriptor` variant: `SkillActivationTool` — the "Skill" tool that the model sees and calls when it wants to activate a skill

2. The `SkillActivationTool` invocation:
   - Receives `{ name: String, arguments: Option<String> }` as `params`
   - Calls `CairnSkillRegistry::activate()`
   - Routes the permission check through `PermissionGate`
   - Fires the activation hook through `HookAction`
   - Emits a `ToolInvocationNodeData` graph event
   - Returns the skill body wrapped in `<skill name="...">...</skill>` XML

3. The skill catalog is delivered as part of the tool context at run start — not as a tool schema, but as a catalog block appended to the system prompt. This gives the model knowledge of available skills at ~100 tokens per skill without putting them in the `tools[]` array.

```rust
/// Builds the skill catalog block for injection at run start.
/// Returns roughly 100 tokens per skill.
pub fn build_skill_catalog_block(
    entries: &[SkillCatalogEntry],
    format: SkillCatalogFormat, // Xml | Markdown | Json
) -> String {
    // Example XML output:
    // <available_skills>
    //   <skill name="run-analysis" invocable_by="model,user">
    //     Analyzes agent run output for anomalies...
    //   </skill>
    //   ...
    // </available_skills>
}
```

4. The `SkillActivationTool` goes through `BuiltinToolRegistry` like all other builtins. No special-case execution path.

### 6.4 Integration with ApprovalSystem

Skills need a distinct approval model from tool invocations. Key differences:

**Tool approval:** Per-invocation. "This tool call, with these params, for this project" needs operator sign-off.

**Skill approval:** Should default to **first-use-per-session-per-scope** for trusted skills, and **always** (or explicit whitelist) for untrusted project skills.

**Three approval modes:**

```rust
pub enum SkillApprovalMode {
    /// No approval required (globally trusted, org-managed skills).
    Automatic,

    /// First use in session requires operator acknowledgement.
    /// Subsequent activations in the same session are automatic.
    FirstUsePerSession,

    /// Every activation requires approval.
    /// For skills with side effects or from untrusted sources.
    AlwaysApprove,

    /// Requires explicit approval grant in skill's tenant configuration.
    /// Default for project skills from untrusted origins.
    TrustGated { require_explicit_grant: bool },
}
```

**Trust gating flow:**
```
repo clone → project created → project skills discovered
→ skills in project/.claude/skills/ are UNTRUSTED
→ operator approves workspace trust (one-time per project)
→ trust grant stored in project config
→ subsequent sessions load project skills without re-prompting
```

This mirrors how editors (VS Code, Claude Code) handle workspace trust. The key invariant: a freshly cloned repo must never auto-activate project skills without explicit operator acknowledgement. A malicious SKILL.md in a repo is a prompt injection vector.

**For the `allowed-tools` field:** In v1, treat as advisory (documentation + audit log). The session's `PermissionGate` remains authoritative on every tool call. A skill declaring `allowed-tools: Bash(git add *)` does NOT automatically grant `Bash(git add *)` permission — it signals to the operator what the skill will do, and the hook can use this metadata to auto-approve those specific calls when the skill is active.

In v1.1, consider a pre-approval contract: if the skill is trusted AND the `allowed-tools` field is present, auto-approve those specific tool calls during skill activation. This requires audit logging.

### 6.5 UX Affordances

**Authoring:** Skills are authored as SKILL.md files in:
- `<workspace-root>/.cairn/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (project-level)
- `~/.cairn/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (user-level, not yet scoped to a project)
- Platform-distributed (org-level, managed through API)

**Review queue:** Before a project skill is trusted, the system should:
1. Display the SKILL.md content to the operator
2. List the `allowed-tools` declarations
3. Show the `compatibility` field if present
4. Require explicit "trust this skill" confirmation

This review flow is the equivalent of macOS's "This app was downloaded from the internet" prompt — it doesn't prevent use, but it creates a deliberate consent moment.

**Slash command registration:** Each trusted skill that has `user-invocable: true` (the default) should register a `/skill-name` slash command in the operator UI. This is the "skill as command" UX that users expect from Claude Code parity.

## 7. Recommended Architecture

### 7.1 Crate Topology

```
cairn-skills (NEW CRATE)
    ↓ depends on
harness-skill (from harness-tools)
cairn-tools (existing)
cairn-domain (existing)

cairn-runtime (existing)
    ↓ depends on
cairn-skills (NEW)
cairn-tools (existing)

cairn-app (existing)
    ↓ depends on
cairn-runtime
cairn-skills (for skill management API routes)
```

**New crate `cairn-skills`** is the adapter layer. It owns:
- `CairnSkillRegistry` trait + `HarnessSkillAdapter` impl
- `SkillScope` / `SkillSession` / `SkillActivationResult` types
- `SkillApprovalMode` + trust gating
- `build_skill_catalog_block()` for context injection
- The `SkillActivationTool` builtin registered in `BuiltinToolRegistry`
- API for skill management (list, upload, delete, trust-grant)

This keeps `cairn-tools` focused on tool primitives and avoids bloating it with skill mechanics.

### 7.2 Data Flow

```
Session start
    → CairnSkillRegistry::catalog(scope) → [SkillCatalogEntry]
    → build_skill_catalog_block(entries) → catalog_block: String
    → inject catalog_block into run system prompt

Agent turn (model invokes Skill tool)
    → SkillActivationTool receives {name, arguments}
    → PermissionGate::check(project, required, execution_class)
    → if HeldForApproval: suspend turn, notify operator
    → HookDispatcher::fire(HookEvent::SkillPreActivation {name, frontmatter})
    → CairnSkillRegistry::activate(name, arguments, session)
    → harness-skill::skill(params, config) internally
    → SkillActivationResult::Ok { body, resources, ... }
    → wrap body: "<skill name='...'>\n{body}\n</skill>"
    → inject into conversation
    → HookDispatcher::fire(HookEvent::SkillPostActivation {name, outcome})
    → GraphEventSink::emit(ToolInvocationNodeData { tool: "skill", ... })

Session end
    → session.activated.clear()  // deduplication state discarded
```

### 7.3 Event Model

New domain events emitted by `cairn-skills`:

```rust
pub enum SkillEvent {
    SkillCatalogLoaded {
        session_id: SessionId,
        project: ProjectKey,
        count: usize,
        scope: SkillScope,
    },
    SkillActivated {
        session_id: SessionId,
        project: ProjectKey,
        skill_name: String,
        skill_dir: PathBuf,
        turn_id: TurnId,
        arguments: Option<String>,
    },
    SkillActivationDenied {
        session_id: SessionId,
        project: ProjectKey,
        skill_name: String,
        reason: SkillDenialReason,
    },
    SkillTrustGranted {
        project: ProjectKey,
        skill_dir: PathBuf,
        granted_by: ActorId,
    },
    SkillTrustRevoked {
        project: ProjectKey,
        skill_dir: PathBuf,
        revoked_by: ActorId,
    },
}
```

### 7.4 Storage Projections

Two new projections:

**`SkillTrustProjection`:** Stores `{project_key, skill_dir, trust_status, granted_at, granted_by}`. Queried at session start to determine which project skills are trusted.

**`ActivatedSkillProjection`:** Stores per-session activated skills for audit. Supports answering "what skills were active when this run happened?" for debugging and reproducibility.

## 8. Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why It Happens | How to Avoid |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| **Skill description poisoning** | Attacker crafts a SKILL.md description that hijacks the model ("ignore previous instructions") | Validate descriptions against injection patterns; use a content policy filter on trust-gated skill registration |
| **Indirect injection via skill output** | A skill body fetched from an external URL contains malicious instructions | Prohibit URL fetching in skill bodies unless explicitly sandboxed; treat all external content as untrusted |
| **Project skill auto-activation** | Model activates a project skill before operator reviews it | Trust gate: project skills require explicit trust grant; no auto-activation without acknowledgement |
| **Skill content lost to compaction** | Long sessions compact the conversation; skill body disappears; model stops following skill | Wrap skill bodies in `<skill name="...">` tags; implement compaction-safe re-attachment up to 25K token budget |
| **Skill version drift** | SKILL.md is edited; session is still running; model uses stale body | Document clearly: edits take effect at next session start; `already_loaded` is immutable during session |
| **`allowed-tools` as security boundary** | Operator assumes declaring `allowed-tools: Bash(*)` in SKILL.md locks the model to those tools | `allowed-tools` is advisory in v1; PermissionGate is the authoritative gate; never trust the frontmatter alone |
| **Skill namespace collision** | Two plugins both ship a `code-review` skill | Plugin-namespaced skills (`plugin-name:skill-name`) prevent collision; non-plugin project skills shadow by priority |
| **Double-activation waste** | Model activates the same skill multiple times in a session | `ActivatedSet` deduplication; second call returns `already_loaded` without re-injecting the body |
| **Skill count bloat** | Operator installs 200 skills; model context at session start is 20K tokens of descriptions | Enforce 1,536-character cap on `description + when_to_use`; implement description truncation with front-loading |
| **Confused deputy via skill** | A skill declares `allowed-tools: Bash(rm -rf *)` and tricks the model into calling it | `allowed-tools` must never implicitly grant permissions; require explicit operator approval for high-risk tool pre-approvals |

---

## 9. Open Questions

The implementor of BP-8 must answer these before cutting code:

### OQ-1: Where does skill storage live?

**The question:** User-level skills (`~/.cairn/skills/`) and project-level skills (`<project-root>/.cairn/skills/`) are filesystem-based and natural. But cairn runs as a server process — it may not have access to the user's home directory or project root in all deployments.

**Options:**
- A. Filesystem-only: skills are files on the server host; operators place them there. Simple but inflexible for remote deployments.
- B. API-managed: skills are uploaded via the API and stored in the database as blobs. Consistent across deployments but loses filesystem-authoring UX.
- C. Hybrid: filesystem for local/team mode; API-managed for cloud mode. Most flexible but requires two code paths.

**Recommendation:** Start with option A for local/team mode (aligns with the cairn architecture principle of "local mode first"). Add option B for API-managed skills in a follow-up PR. The `CairnSkillRegistry` trait seam makes this straightforward.

### OQ-2: How do skills interact with the run approval system (RFC 020)?

**The question:** Cairn's approval system (RFC 020) gates tool invocations by policy. Skills are not tool invocations in the traditional sense — they load prose into context. But skills can *trigger subsequent tool calls* that themselves go through the approval system.

**Sub-questions:**
- Should skill activation itself go through the RFC 020 approval gate, or only the tool calls the skill triggers?
- Should `SkillApprovalMode::AlwaysApprove` integrate with the existing `HeldForApproval` path in `PermissionCheckResult`?
- When a skill is trust-gated and the run is in autonomous mode (no human in the loop), what happens? Block the run? Escalate to operator notification?

**Recommendation:** Skill activation should go through the RFC 020 gate for `TrustGated` and `AlwaysApprove` modes. Map to `HeldForApproval` in autonomous runs — this halts the run and notifies the operator, which is the correct behavior. Do not silently proceed with untrusted project skills in autonomous mode.
