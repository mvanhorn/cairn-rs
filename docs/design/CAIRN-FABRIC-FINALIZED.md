# Cairn ↔ FlowFabric Finalized Architecture

**Status**: finalization round. Captures the wiring, feature gates, operator workflow, and outstanding asks as of FF @1b19dd10 and cairn branch `feat/cairn-fabric-finalization`. Updated for RFC-011 phase-1 mechanical sweep (rev bump a098710 → 1b19dd10).

`cairn-fabric` is a **thin bridge**. FlowFabric owns execution truth in Valkey; cairn translates HTTP handler calls into FF FCALLs and projects FF events back into cairn-store for query paths. This doc is the runbook, not a design proposal — behaviour is already shipped.

**Write path**: handler → trait → Fabric adapter → `FabricServices::{runs,tasks,sessions}` → FCALL → Valkey. FF state transitions emit bridge events → `EventBridge` queue → cairn-store append → projections update.

**Read path**: handler → trait → store projection (`RunReadModel::get`, `list_by_session`, etc). Fabric is NOT on the read path — FF doesn't index by cairn's `(tenant, workspace, project)` scope.

**Scanners** (FF-owned, cairn runs none of its own): `DelayedPromoter`, `LeaseExpiryScanner`, `AttemptTimeoutScanner`, `ExecutionDeadlineScanner`, `SuspensionTimeoutScanner`, `PendingWaitpointExpiryScanner`, `BudgetResetScanner`, `BudgetReconciler`, `QuotaReconciler`, `DependencyReconciler`, `FlowProjector`, `IndexReconciler`, `RetentionTrimmer`, `UnblockScanner`. The pre-Fabric `FabricRecoveryStub` was retired when finalization landed.

---

## 2. Feature gates

The runtime path is selected at **compile time** by cargo features on
`cairn-app`. There is no longer a runtime env var toggle — this was removed
in the PR #27 consolidation because "Fabric off" production builds are
unsupported (FF is the only correctness-guaranteed path).

| Flag / env var | Default | Scope | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CAIRN_FABRIC_WAITPOINT_HMAC_SECRET` | unset (boot fails) | env var | 64-char hex (32-byte) HMAC secret. **Required** — boot aborts with `FabricError::Config` if unset (no silent degrade). |
| `CAIRN_FABRIC_WAITPOINT_HMAC_KID` | `k1` when secret set | env var | Kid for the HMAC secret. Must be non-empty and free of `:` (FF field-name delimiter). |
| `CAIRN_FABRIC_WORKER_CAPABILITIES` | empty set | env var | Comma-separated capability tokens. Passed to `ff_scheduler::Scheduler::claim_for_worker`. Empty = matches only executions with no capability requirements. |
| `CAIRN_FABRIC_HOST` / `_PORT` / `_TLS` / `_CLUSTER` | `localhost` / `6379` / off / off | env var | Valkey connection. `_CLUSTER=1` uses cluster mode; all FCALL KEYS on a single `{p:N}` hash tag so this is cluster-safe without extra wiring. |
| `CAIRN_FABRIC_LEASE_TTL_MS` / `_GRANT_TTL_MS` | `180_000` / `5_000` | env var | Timing knobs. Lease default bumped 30s → 180s in F63 to match pull-mode orchestrate cadence (operator approvals + LLM tail + tool exec routinely exceed 30s); see [FF#371](https://github.com/avifenesh/FlowFabric/issues/371) for the upstream dual-door-deadlock root cause this default mitigates. |

## 3. Operator runbook

### 3.1 Enabling Fabric

Fabric is the default — `cargo build -p cairn-app` produces a binary
that requires Valkey at boot. To get a Fabric-backed deployment up:

1. Run a Valkey 7.0+ instance reachable from cairn. **Valkey 8.0+ strongly recommended** — the 8.x line patches a series of Lua sandbox CVEs (CVE-2024-46981, CVE-2024-31449, CVE-2025-49844, CVE-2025-46817/18/19) and is FlowFabric's tested floor. Boot emits a WARN when the detected Valkey major is below 8; boot hard-fails when below 7 (no Functions API). The check retries for 60 s to tolerate rolling upgrades — see `crates/cairn-fabric/src/version_check.rs`.
2. Load the FlowFabric Lua library into Valkey (`scripts/run-fabric-integration-tests.sh` does this from a pinned FF checkout; production operators seed from their CI artefact).
3. Generate a 32-byte HMAC secret: `openssl rand -hex 32`.
4. Set env vars before boot. The HMAC secret is **required** — boot fails loud if it's missing:
   ```bash
   export CAIRN_FABRIC_HOST=valkey.internal
   export CAIRN_FABRIC_PORT=6379
   export CAIRN_FABRIC_WAITPOINT_HMAC_SECRET=<64-hex>
   export CAIRN_FABRIC_WAITPOINT_HMAC_KID=prod-2026-04
   ```
   Omitting `CAIRN_FABRIC_WAITPOINT_HMAC_SECRET` (or supplying an invalid length / non-hex value) aborts `FabricServices::start` with a typed `FabricError::Config` — we do not ship a runtime that would reject every `ff_suspend_execution` with `hmac_secret_not_initialized` at runtime.
5. Boot cairn-app. You should see:
   ```
   INFO connecting to valkey host=valkey.internal port=6379 tls=false cluster=false
   INFO seeded waitpoint HMAC secret kid=prod-2026-04 partitions=256
   INFO fabric runtime started
   ```

### 3.2 Worker capability advertisement

Workers that can claim tasks with specific hardware/runtime requirements advertise them via:

```bash
export CAIRN_FABRIC_WORKER_CAPABILITIES=gpu,cuda-12,linux-x86_64
```

FF builds a deterministic sorted CSV from the cairn-side `BTreeSet`. An execution's `required_capabilities` must be a subset of the worker's for `ff_issue_claim_grant` to succeed; otherwise FF blocks the execution and the `UnblockScanner` promotes it when a matching worker registers.

### 3.3 HMAC rotation

Not automated in this round. FF ships `rotate_waitpoint_hmac_secret` in `ff-test` fixtures; cairn will wrap it in a dedicated admin endpoint in a follow-up round. Until then: redeploy with a new `CAIRN_FABRIC_WAITPOINT_HMAC_SECRET`, accept that in-flight suspensions signed by the old key fail `invalid_token` until their waitpoints close. No silent data loss — operator sees the typed error.

### 3.4 Local development without Valkey

Production requires Valkey. For handler-surface iteration without one,
cairn-app integration tests under `crates/cairn-app/tests/` boot
`AppState` via a read-only `FakeFabric` fixture
(`crates/cairn-app/tests/support/fake_fabric.rs`) — it forwards every
read method (`get` / `list_by_session` / …) to the projection store and
returns `RuntimeError::Internal` on every mutation. The fixture wires
into `AppBootstrap::router_with_injected_runtime`, which accepts a
caller-provided `InMemoryServices`.

Running the production binary (`cargo run -p cairn-app`) without a
reachable Valkey will fail at boot with `FabricError::Config` — this is
intentional (no silent degrade).

### 3.5 Single backing stack

Post kill-in-memory-runtime, there is exactly one backing for
Run/Task/Session services: `Fabric{Run,Task,Session}ServiceAdapter`
against Valkey + FF. `AppState::new` wires it unconditionally;
`InMemoryServices::with_store_and_core(store, runs, tasks, sessions)` is
the only factory.

The courtesy in-memory `RunServiceImpl` / `TaskServiceImpl` /
`SessionServiceImpl` backings, together with their
`InMemoryServices::{new, with_store, with_fabric}` constructors, existed
during the Fabric migration as a compile-time escape hatch. Post
migration they carried no correctness guarantees (state transitions
drifted from Fabric's, no scanner lifecycle participation) and were
removed — see CHANGELOG for the full scope.

The deleted pieces in Fabric finalization were: `FabricRecoveryStub`
(cairn-fabric side) and `RecoveryServiceImpl` (cairn-runtime side).
Both were passive duplicates of FF's scanners — FF owns recovery
unconditionally.

### 3.6 Common failures

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `ff_suspend_execution rejected: hmac_secret_not_initialized` | HMAC secret not seeded on execution partitions | Set `CAIRN_FABRIC_WAITPOINT_HMAC_SECRET` and reboot. |
| `ff_deliver_signal rejected: invalid_token` | Waitpoint token stale (HMAC rotated mid-flight) or client passed empty token | Re-read from `waitpoint_hash.waitpoint_token` via cairn's `read_waitpoint_token` helper. |
| `scheduler claim_for_worker: SchedulerError::Config(...)` on capability token | Operator supplied a token with `,` or whitespace | Fix config — cairn validates at boot, FF validates at claim. |
| CairnTask dropped without terminal call (log warn) | Handler forgot to call `complete` / `fail` / `cancel` | FF's `LeaseExpiryScanner` promotes the execution back to eligible when the lease TTL fires; no data loss, just latency. |

---

## 4. Orchestrator integration

The GATHER → DECIDE → EXECUTE loop in `cairn-orchestrator` threads FF
primitives through a narrow, **non-consuming** handle — `TaskFrameSink`
(`crates/cairn-orchestrator/src/task_sink.rs`). This keeps the loop
independent of FF's lease-lifetime contract (where `complete` /
`fail` / `suspend_for_approval` consume `self`) while still populating
FF's attempt-scoped stream for audit + cross-process resumption.

### 4.1 `TaskFrameSink` trait

Five methods, all non-consuming:

| Method | Called from | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `log_tool_call(name, args)` | `loop_runner.rs` §5a (pre-execute), §4 (approval gate) | Intent frame — survives a mid-dispatch restart |
| `log_tool_result(name, output, success, duration_ms)` | `loop_runner.rs` §5b (post-execute, per result) | Outcome frame — balances the intent frame |
| `log_llm_response(model, tokens_in, tokens_out, latency_ms)` | `loop_runner.rs` §3b' (post-decide) | Cost + latency audit off `DecideOutput` fields |
| `save_checkpoint(context_json)` | `loop_runner.rs` §6b (after `CheckpointHook::save`) | Matches PR #27's `restore_frames()` read half |
| `is_lease_healthy()` | `loop_runner.rs` §1b (per-iteration, before gather) | Bail before committing any expensive side effect |

Default impl: `NoOpTaskSink` — all writes succeed instantly, lease
always reports healthy. Used when the caller has no live
`CairnTask`; the `EventLog` bridge events continue to drive cairn-store
projections + SSE telemetry unchanged.

Production impl: blanket `impl TaskFrameSink for cairn_fabric::CairnTask`
— delegates to the existing `StreamWriter` (ff-sdk
`ff_append_frame`-backed). Errors are mapped to
`OrchestratorError::Execute`; the loop runner logs and continues so a
frame append that fails (network blip, Valkey hiccup) does not fail a
run.

### 4.2 Stream frames are ADDITIVE

Cairn-store bridge events (`RuntimeEvent::ToolInvoked`,
`RuntimeEvent::CheckpointRecorded`, etc.) are **not replaced**. Stream
frames write to FF's attempt-scoped Valkey stream; bridge events write
to cairn-store's event log via `EventBridge`. Two independent channels:

```
cairn-orchestrator                         FF / Valkey
      │                                          │
      ├── OrchestratorEventEmitter ──→ cairn-store.projections (SSE, read paths)
      │
      └── TaskFrameSink (optional)   ──→ ff:exec:{p:N}:attempt:N:stream (restore_frames)
```

If the FF stream write fails, the run continues using the bridge-event
projections. If the bridge write fails, the stream-frame replay is
still intact. The two paths intersect only at authoritative FF state
(exec_core, flow_core, etc.) — not via shared cairn state.

### 4.3 Approval suspension handoff

When the loop returns `LoopTermination::WaitingApproval { approval_id }`,
the caller (HTTP handler) decides which suspension primitive to fire:

- **Service-level path**: call `state.runtime.runs.enter_waiting_approval(&run_id)`.
  This is the canonical path today — it works whether the caller holds
  a `CairnTask` or not. `RunService` under the Fabric adapter routes to
  `FabricRunService::enter_waiting_approval` which runs
  `ff_suspend_execution`. **Prerequisite**: the run must have been
  claimed first — `ff_suspend_execution` rejects a non-active
  execution. Callers that start a run via `POST /v1/runs` and want to
  enter an approval gate before a worker claims it must issue
  `POST /v1/runs/{id}/claim` (or `runs.claim(&run_id)` through the
  service trait) to activate the lease. See the `RunService::claim`
  docstring for the one-claim-per-lifecycle contract (non-idempotent
  on Fabric; a second claim fails at the grant gate unless the run
  has been through a suspend/resume cycle).
- **Task-level path** (preferred when the caller holds a live
  `CairnTask`): call `cairn_task.suspend_for_approval(&approval_id, None)`.
  This consumes the `CairnTask` and the task stays suspended until
  `ff_deliver_signal` fires on the matching approval waitpoint. Use
  this when the run was claim-active via the orchestrator's own lease
  (the loop was already running inside the task's execution context).

The loop never holds a `CairnTask` across iterations (the consuming
self contract would require consuming it mid-iteration, which the
state machine doesn't allow). So the decision of which primitive to
fire is a CALLER concern, not an orchestrator concern. The orchestrator
returns the `approval_id` and exits; the caller knows which path it's on.

### 4.4 Lease-health gate semantics

`task_sink.is_lease_healthy()` polls ff-sdk's 3-consecutive-renewal
threshold. On false, the loop returns
`LoopTermination::Failed { reason: "lease unhealthy" }` BEFORE any
expensive side effect (next iteration's gather / decide / execute).
This is:

- **Correct**: FF rejects every fcall on an unhealthy lease with
  `stale_lease` anyway; bailing early saves work and avoids partial
  state.
- **Cheap**: polling is a struct-field read (ff-sdk tracks the
  renewal counter internally). No network round-trip.
- **Caller-observable**: the handler sees `Failed { reason: "lease
  unhealthy" }` and can call `cairn_task.fail_with_retry(...)` to let
  FF's retry policy decide whether to reschedule or terminal-fail.

### 4.5 Checkpoint-frame failure semantics (design nuance)

Stream-frame writes are intentionally best-effort — the loop runner
logs and continues on every frame-append failure, including
`save_checkpoint`. This matches the existing policy for
`CheckpointHook::save()` (pre-PR #29 behavior) and keeps both channels
consistent.

A lost checkpoint frame means cross-process resumption via
`restore_frames()` silently misses that iteration's state. In
practice this is masked by:

1. The cairn-side `CheckpointHook::save()` call (still running in
   parallel), which persists the checkpoint to cairn-store's event
   log via the injected hook.
2. FF's own lease renewal — a lost frame on a healthy lease means
   the next iteration's checkpoint catches up; a lost frame on an
   unhealthy lease triggers the lease-health gate (§4.4) which
   terminates the loop cleanly.

If we later want checkpoint-frame failure to be fatal (e.g. a
recovery-first mode where cross-process resume is load-bearing), the
trait can gain a `save_checkpoint_fatal -> Result<(), Fatal>` variant
at the sink layer; the loop-runner check becomes strict. That's a
future design call — today's contract is **advisory**, matching the
cairn-side hook.

### 4.6 Dep graph

`cairn-orchestrator` now depends directly on `cairn-fabric`
(`[dependencies]`). The blanket `TaskFrameSink` impl for `CairnTask`
lives in cairn-orchestrator so cairn-fabric stays unaware of the
orchestrator trait; no cycle. The orchestrator → stream integration
test (`crates/cairn-fabric/tests/integration/test_orchestrator_stream.rs`)
adds cairn-orchestrator as a `[dev-dependencies]` of cairn-fabric to
name the trait from the test; this is a dev-only cycle that Cargo
isolates from the library graph.

## 5. Outstanding FF asks

All three original asks landed upstream in the RFC-011 phase-1 rev bump (a098710 → 1b19dd10). Cairn adopted them in the mechanical sweep on `feat/rfc011-mechanical-sweep`.

1. ~~**`pub fn FlowFabricWorker::claim_from_grant(grant: ClaimGrant) -> Result<ClaimedTask, SdkError>`**~~ — **CLOSED** (FF #14). Public API landed upstream; cairn-fabric wired in RFC-011 phase-2 (pending).
2. ~~**`pub fn parse_report_usage_result(raw: &Value) -> Result<ReportUsageResult, SdkError>`**~~ — **CLOSED** (FF #16). `budget_service.rs::parse_spend_result` deleted; cairn now calls `ff_sdk::task::parse_report_usage_result` directly.
3. ~~**Scheduler-mediated `claim_resumed_execution`**~~ — **CLOSED** (FF #15). `FlowFabricWorker::claim_from_reclaim_grant` is public; cairn-fabric adoption tracked under RFC-011 phase-2.

---

## 6. Known gaps

Accepted limitations as of finalization — each has a follow-up round scoped.

- **~~`FabricTaskService::declare_dependency` + `check_dependencies` return errors / empty vecs~~ (resolved)**. Task dependencies are now FF-authoritative: `declare_dependency` issues `ff_stage_dependency_edge` (on the flow partition) + `ff_apply_dependency_to_child` (on the child's execution partition), and `check_dependencies` reads live state via `ff_evaluate_flow_eligibility` + per-edge HGET on the child's dep hash. The cairn-side `TaskDependencyReadModel` trait is deleted; FF is the single source of truth. Preconditions: both endpoints must belong to the same session (FF flow-edges can't cross flows) and `submit` eagerly calls `ff_add_execution_to_flow` so every session-bound task is a flow member. Prerequisite failure auto-skips dependents to `TaskState::Failed + FailureClass::DependencyFailed` via the push listener; reconciler fallback closes the loop at 15 s intervals for any missed publish. See `crates/cairn-fabric/src/services/task_service.rs::declare_dependency` and the integration suite at `crates/cairn-fabric/tests/integration/test_task_dependencies.rs`.
- **`FabricTaskService::list_expired_leases`** returns empty (FF's `LeaseExpiryScanner` handles expiry server-side). The admin handler `expire_task_leases_handler` is delegated via the adapter to the cairn-store projection — see `crates/cairn-app/src/fabric_adapter.rs:556-565` for the `TaskReadModel::list_expired_leases` fallback path.
- **`FabricTaskService::list_by_state`** and **`FabricSessionService::list`** return empty — FF doesn't index by cairn's `(tenant, workspace, project)` scope. Adapter delegates to `TaskReadModel` / `SessionReadModel` projections. Not a defect; it's the read-path split.
- **Provider budgets and tenant quotas** (`handlers/providers.rs` + `handlers/admin.rs`) remain on the legacy `BudgetServiceImpl` / `QuotaServiceImpl` over the cairn event log. `FabricBudgetService` and `FabricQuotaService` are per-run admission controls, not tenant-wide ceilings; they ride alongside as new surfaces, not replacements.
- **`scripts/smoke-test.sh` HTTP harness historically assumed a permissive state machine** (the in-memory `RunServiceImpl` allows `pause` without a prior `claim`, etc). In the default Fabric build, FF enforces strict state transitions — a run must be claimed and active before it can be paused/resumed, tasks must be submitted-and-claimed before lease operations. 8 smoke sections (`POST /v1/runs/:id/pause`, `/resume`, `POST /v1/tasks/:id/claim`, `/release-lease`) returned HTTP 500 on the fabric path. These are **NOT runtime defects** — FF's strictness is correct production behaviour. PR #27 lands a short-lived worker-loop fixture (claim-then-operate) in `crates/cairn-app/src/bin/smoke_worker.rs` that exercises FF semantics correctly.
  - In-memory path (`--features in-memory-runtime`): 97/97 pass, 4 skipped.
  - Fabric path (default build + Valkey + FF lua loaded): 89/97 pass on the
    pre-PR#27 script (8 harness gaps); the PR #27 worker-loop fixture
    closes those gaps.

## 7. Known tech debt (flagged during finalization-round audit)

Severity ordered. Each item has a follow-up round scoped.

### ✅ CLOSED: HIGH — Event emission gate bug

*Status*: fixed on `feat/task-emission-gate-fix`.

Was: `FabricTaskService::complete` / `fail` / `cancel` gated `BridgeEvent::TaskStateChanged` emission on `ActiveTaskRegistry` membership, so tasks claimed via any path other than `FabricTaskService::claim` (external API callers, cross-process claim/complete) silently skipped projection emission and drifted the cairn-store `TaskReadModel` from FF's exec_core.

Now: emission is unconditional after FF confirms the terminal transition. Projections are idempotent on `(task_id, event_id)`, so a redundant emit from a parallel path is a no-op re-write. Regression guards land in `crates/cairn-fabric/tests/integration/test_event_emission.rs` — four tests exercising the happy-path baseline plus complete/fail/cancel via a fresh `FabricTaskService` (simulating cross-process claim + terminal).

### ✅ CLOSED: MEDIUM — `ActiveTaskRegistry` duplicates FF-owned state

*Status*: deleted on `feat/task-emission-gate-fix`.

Was: `DashMap<TaskId, {execution_id, lease_id, lease_epoch, attempt_index, Option<ClaimedTask>}>` — a cairn-side latency cache for fields FF already owned, and the mechanism the emission-gate bug rode through.

Now: entire `active_tasks.rs` module removed. `FabricTaskService::resolve_active_lease` + `resolve_lease_or_placeholder` always HGETALL `exec_core`; `CairnTask` carries its `ClaimedTask` directly (no registry intermediary). `FabricServices` no longer exposes a `pub registry` field. Net deletion ≈ 250 LOC.

### MEDIUM — Bridge-event completeness audit

The finalization-round smoke-test caught a single-emit gap: `FabricSessionService::create` did not emit a `BridgeEvent::SessionCreated`, so sessions were never written to the cairn-store projection, and every subsequent handler that read `sessions.get(session_id)` returned `None`. Fixed in commit 4 (see `event_bridge.rs` + `services/session_service.rs`).

The same class of gap could exist for any FF mutation path cairn-fabric exposes. A systematic audit should walk every public method on `FabricRunService` / `FabricTaskService` / `FabricSessionService` / `FabricBudgetService` / `FabricQuotaService` and verify: every mutation that changes FF state that cairn-app reads back from the projection has a corresponding `BridgeEvent` emitted. No cairn-app read-path should depend on a state change that only lives in Valkey.

Bugs of this shape are invisible to unit tests (services write to FF correctly) and to live FF integration tests (each one tests the fabric layer in isolation, not the full handler → adapter → fabric → store-projection chain). The integration-readiness gate is cairn-app smoke — run `scripts/smoke-test.sh` (default build) on every cairn-fabric mutation-surface change.

### LOW — Smoke-test harness rewrite for Fabric state machine

`scripts/smoke-test.sh` historically simulated in-memory permissive state transitions (pause without prior claim, etc.). In the default Fabric build, FF enforces strict state transitions, so 8 sections (pause/resume/claim/release-lease on freshly created runs and tasks) returned HTTP 500 — the runtime is correct, the test's expectations weren't. PR #27 replaces those sections with a worker-loop fixture (`crates/cairn-app/src/bin/smoke_worker.rs`) that claims before operating so the fabric path gets exercised end-to-end.

### LOW — CairnTask tag micro-cache

*Location*: `crates/cairn-fabric/src/worker_sdk.rs:174-180`.

`CairnTask` caches `run_id`, `session_id`, `project` extracted from FF exec_core tags at claim time. Struct-lifetime only, not persistent. Re-reading tags on every terminal call adds an HGET per call but eliminates a staleness risk if operator-directed reassignment ever enters scope. Keep as-is until that feature arrives.

### LOW — `TaskLeaseClaimed.lease_expires_at_ms` is a snapshot

*Location*: `crates/cairn-fabric/src/event_bridge.rs:56-62`.

The `TaskLeaseClaimed` bridge event payload carries `lease_expires_at_ms`, which is also stored on FF's `exec_core` as `current_lease_expires_at`. This is a moment-in-time snapshot for projection display, not a cached field with invalidation semantics — consumers must not treat the value as tracked (FF can extend / renew the lease after the event is emitted). Documented here so future readers don't mistake it for live state.

### ~~LOW — `list_child_runs` silently truncates at 10k events~~ (resolved)

Both `FabricRunServiceAdapter::list_child_runs` and `RunServiceImpl::list_child_runs` now delegate to `RunReadModel::list_by_parent_run` (added on the trait in this round). The projection is served by the existing `idx_runs_parent` partial index (V003__create_runs.sql) on Postgres / SQLite, and by a direct HashMap filter on `InMemoryStore`. No event-log scan, no 10k truncation.

## 8. Versioning

- FF crates: `ff-core = "0.1"`, `ff-sdk = "0.1"`, `ff-engine = "0.1"`, `ff-scheduler = "0.1"`, `ff-script = "0.1"`, `ferriskey = "0.1"` — consumed from crates.io as of FlowFabric v0.1.1. The caret requirement tracks 0.1.x patches automatically; bump to `^0.2` only when FF cuts a deliberate breaking release.
- Cairn-fabric crate version: `0.1.0` (unpublished, `publish = false`).
- `scripts/run-fabric-integration-tests.sh` `FF_REV` pins the upstream tag solely to load the matching `flowfabric.lua` bundle into the test Valkey; the Rust crates come from crates.io, so this ref only controls Lua-bundle parity.
